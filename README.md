# 🧘 Wellness Tourism – End-to-End MLOps Pipeline (GitHub Actions + Hugging Face)

This project builds a complete *MLOps workflow* for a Wellness Tourism Classification Model using:

- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Hugging Face Datasets Hub (Data Source)
- scikit-learn Machine Learning Models
- Automatic Model Evaluation + Upload to Hugging Face
- Auto-commit of pipeline outputs back to GitHub

It demonstrates your ability to work with *real-world MLOps, automation, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and Hugging Face integration*.

---

## 🚀 *Project Goals*

1. Load dataset from Hugging Face Hub  
2. Preprocess and clean the dataset  
3. Train ML model (Random Forest / XGBoost)  
4. Evaluate model performance  
5. Upload final model to Hugging Face Model Hub  
6. Automatically push artifacts into GitHub via GitHub Actions

## 🤖 *ML Algorithms Used*

- Random Forest Classifier  
- Feature Encoding (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)  
- Train-test Split  
- Imputation for missing values  

You can easily plug in XGBoost or any other ML model later.

## 🔄 *CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)*

### The workflow does the following automatically:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Checkout Repo | Gets latest code |
| 2. Install Dependencies | From requirements.txt |
| 3. Load Dataset | Pulls dataset from Hugging Face |
| 4. Preprocess Dataset | Cleans + encodes features |
| 5. Train Model | Saves model + encoders |
| 6. Evaluate Model | Generates metrics |
| 7. Upload Model | Pushes to Hugging Face Model Hub |
| 8. Auto Commit | Commits artifacts back to GitHub |

## ⚙️ *GitHub Actions Setup*

Create secret:
HF_TOKEN = your Hugging Face write token

Required permissions (Settings → Actions → General):

- *Allow all actions*
- *Workflow permissions → Read & Write*

---

## 🧠 *Dataset*

The dataset is hosted on Hugging Face:
Required permissions (Settings → Actions → General):
- *Allow all actions*
- *Workflow permissions → Read & Write*

  ---

## 🧠 *Dataset*

The dataset is hosted on Hugging Face:
chandra1024/tourism_wellness

It contains:

- Tourist activity preferences  
- Wellness category labels  
- Demographics  
- Travel patterns and habits  

---

## 📈 *Model Outputs*
The pipeline generates:

- model.pkl – trained classifier  
- encoder.pkl – preprocessing encoders  
- metrics.json – accuracy, f1-score, recall, precision  
- Feature importance plots  
- Cleaned dataset  

All saved in:
artifacts/
models/
data/

## ☁️ *Model Deployment to Hugging Face*

Your trained model will automatically appear here:
